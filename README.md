# CodeClash
It was an attempt to create a competitive programming platform where a  coder can battle 1 on 1 with another coder. Each battle will have an Entry fee. and the winner will get a cash prize from the collected pool of money.
Multiple coders can also join/create a coding room.

# Demo

Currently, the UX is not that great. The website is slow. and there are only 2 questions uploaded.
